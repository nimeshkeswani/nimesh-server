----Using Docker----:

To build the docker image:
docker build -t nimesh/nimesh-server .

To list docker images:
-a show all images (default hides intermediate images)
docker images -a

To run the image:
docker run -p 49160:8080 -d nimesh/nimesh-server

To stop the container:
docker stop <container id>

To list containers:
-a shows all containers (default shows just running)
docker ps -a

To print app output:
docker logs <container id>

To enter the container:
docker exec -it <container id> bash

To remove all images:
docker rmi $(docker images -aq)

To remove all containers:
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)

To delete all Images, Containers, Volumes and Networks:
docker system prune -a

----Using Docker Compose----:

To download images, if any:
docker-compose pull

To build images using Dockerfiles, if any:
docker-compose build

To start the containers as a service:
docker-compose up

To stop containers and remove containers, networks, volumes, and images:
--remove-orphans removes containers for services not defined in the Compose file
-v removes named volumes declared in the `volumes` section of the Compose file and anonymous volumes attached to containers
docker-compose down --remove-orphans -v

To run one-off commands for your services:
docker-compose run <service name> <command>
For example, to see what environment variables are available to the web service:
docker-compose run web env
